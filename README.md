The approach I wanted to take with this assignment was to simulate a natural predator/prey relationship. I wanted to give my boids energy and hunger, which depletes over time, and the ability to reproduce based on the condition of these variables. I based my predator/prey boids on bison and wolves in the north American plains, with bison using grass to replenish their energy and wolves eating bison to replenish theirs. I wanted to allow the boids to create unique offspring, with different eye sizes, body sizes, hearing and detection abilities and different patterns, however I did not have enough time to implement this. I instead opted to allow the boids to roam freely in the clouds, chasing and being chased. What I was aiming to do with the children was to enable the boids to evolve and adapt to their surroundings, following Terrence McKennaâ€™s ideas about a constantly evolving system, and tying in to Alan Watts Wu Wei concept.
